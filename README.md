# AppPipes - Angular

This simple Angular application demonstrates the functionality of all built-in Angular pipes, as well as examples of custom pipes.

## Technologies Used
- **Angular:** A frontend framework for building web applications.
- **Node.js:** A JavaScript runtime environment for server-side execution.
- **TypeScript:** A typed superset of JavaScript.
- **PrimeNG:** A collection of rich UI components for Angular.
- **PrimeFlex:** A styling framework for PrimeNG components.

## Key Features
- **Demonstration of Built-in Pipes:** All Angular pipes (date, number, currency, percent, uppercase, lowercase, titlecase, async, etc.) are showcased with clear and concise examples.
- **Custom Pipes:** Various custom pipes are included to perform specific tasks such as custom data formatting, list filtering, and more.Clear and Modular Structure: The code is organized logically, making it easy to understand and maintain.


## Development server

1. Clona el Repositorio:
```ts

  git clone https://github.com/jissykakin/appPipesAngular.git

```

2.Install the npm package.
```
  cd appPipesAngular

  npm install

```

Run, for a dev server. 

```ts
  ng serve
```

Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
